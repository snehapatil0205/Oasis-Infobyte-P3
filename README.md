## 🌟 NYC Airbnb Data Analysis Dashboard  

I’m excited to share my latest project — a **Power BI Dashboard** that dives deep into **New York City Airbnb data**! This interactive visualization captures insights into key metrics such as:  

📊 **Host and Review Analysis:**  
- Average number of reviews: **4.68**  
- Reviews per month: **0.06**  
- Top hosts by listing count (e.g., Yervand, Yana)  

🏠 **Room Type and Pricing Insights:**  
- **Entire home/apt** is the most popular option (64%), followed by **Private rooms** (32%) and **Shared rooms** (3%)  
- Price distribution across various **neighborhoods**  

📍 **Geographical Trends:**  
- Minimum nights required by different neighborhoods  
- Insights into neighborhood popularity — **West Village, Williamsburg,** etc.  

🔍 **Filters and Interactivity:**  
The dashboard includes interactive filters by **year**, **neighborhood**, and **room type** — making it easy to drill down into specific insights.
